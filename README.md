# Horisean

For this project I was tasked with refactoring code to meet accessibility standards. This included creating descriptive alt ids for the images on the Horisean home page. I was also able to consolidate a considerable amount of code in the css style sheet by recognizing classes with identicle attributes, renaming them, and merging them--all without changing the layout or function of the page.
